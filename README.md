# Weather__App
Using Python requests


<b>Project idea</b> â€“ The weather app has provided us with an API from https://openweathermap.org/ through which we can gather
all the information about the status of the weather, condition, etc in real-time. The idea of this project is to create a weather app 
using the weatherapi that will give us all the information about the climatic and weatheric condition of a particular place.
